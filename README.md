# Flood-Resilience-Classification
A Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python-based framework for data-driven classification of flood resilience using multi-temporal satellite embeddings. This tool autonomously defines resilience classes from percentile-based thresholds, eliminating subjective cutoffs for scalable, objective post-flood assessment.
